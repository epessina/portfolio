# Personal portfolio

> This project is **work in progress**

## Local development

The project is built using React. To develop the service locally you need:

- Node.js v12 or later,
- Yarn 1.x.x

To set up Node.js, I suggest using [nvm][https://github.com/creationix/nvm], so you can manage multiple versions easily. Once you have installed nvm, you can go inside the directory of the project and simply run `nvm install`, the `.nvmrc` file will install and select the correct version if you donâ€™t already have it.

To install Yarn, run `npm install --global yarn`.

Once you have all the dependency in place, you can launch:

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

This commands will install the dependencies and start the project locally on port 3000.
